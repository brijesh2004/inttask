Advantages Of Router:
Security: The information which is transmitted to the network will traverse the entire cable, but the only specified device which has been addressed can read the data.
Reliability: If the server has stopped functioning, the network goes down, but no other networks are affected that are served by the router.
Performance: Router enhances the overall performance of the network. Suppose there are 24 workstations in a network generates a same amount of traffic. This increases the traffic load on the network. Router splits the single network into two networks of 12 workstations each, reduces the traffic load by half.
