NIC stands for network interface card.
NIC is a hardware component used to connect a computer with another computer onto a network
It can support a transfer rate of 10,100 to 1000 Mb/s.
The MAC address or physical address is encoded on the network card chip which is assigned by the IEEE to identify a network card uniquely. The MAC address is stored in the PROM (Programmable read-only memory).
